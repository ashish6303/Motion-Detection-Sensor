# Motion-Detection-Sensor
Embedded System Using Raspberry Pi
Motion detection using a PIR sensor circuit can be used for providing security to home, shopping malls etc, as the PIR sensor used in this system detects the motion of humans around this circuit. With the help of a RaspberryPi, we can identify the motion of a human which was detected by the sensor. This system can be used at any place where security is needed. Security is needed by everyone in society now-a-days to protect their property or confidential information from others which is sensor sense a human motion and then transmit the signal wirelessly.
On clicking on this url we we go to online simmulator where we have to put our code for simmulation then click on pin no 13 then it will show that "Motion Detected"-
